        Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous
        system has been invaded by an unknown microorganism. The organisms fuse
        to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the
        transporter's biofilters couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a
        K-complex corresponding to an REM state. The engineering section's
        critical. Destruction is imminent. Their robes contain ultritium, highly
        explosive, virtually undetectable by your transporter.

        Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon
        torpedoes. Something strange on the detector circuit. The weapons must
        have disrupted our communicators. You saw something as tasty as meat,
        but inorganically materialized out of patterns used by our transporters.
        Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement in science, the
        beginning of wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All transporters off.

        It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic
        waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem, the entire
        nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device
        like that would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have
        undergone some kind of selective molecular polarization. I haven't
        determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could
        alter the photons with phase discriminators.

        Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector. According to
        coordinates, we have travelled 7,000 light years and are located near
        the system J-25. Tractor beam released, sir. Force field maintaining our
        hull integrity. Damage report? Sections 27, 28 and 29 on decks four,
        five and six destroyed. Without our shields, at this range it is
        probable a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise.

        Communication is not possible. The shuttle has no power. Using the
        gravitational pull of a star to slingshot back in time? We are going to
        Starbase Montgomery for Engineering consultations prompted by minor
        read-out anomalies. Probes have recorded unusual levels of geological
        activity in all five planetary systems. Assemble a team. Look at records
        of the Drema quadrant. Would these scans detect artificial transmissions
        as well as natural signals?

        Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply
        calibration. Force fields have been established on all turbo lifts and
        crawlways. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on warp-drive systems.
        Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within normal parameters. I
        read an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod. The bomb had
        a molecular-decay detonator. Detecting some unusual fluctuations in
        subspace frequencies.

        Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface.
        Stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for
        Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced
        communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24
        hours' reserve power. Shield effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent.
        We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without
        warp drive could cross in the given time.
